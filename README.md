pelican-vapor-theme
===================

Adaptation of [Vapor Ghost theme][1] to [Pelican static site generator][2]. Vapor was originaly made for [Ghost][3] blogging engine, and since I liked how it looks but didn't want to give up Pelican, this came out.


This is not a complete port, currently only home page and post page are ported. You can see how it looks on [my blog][4]. There's also plenty of examples on the [Vapor home page][1].
